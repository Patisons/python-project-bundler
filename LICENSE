# DO WHAT YOU WANT LICENSE

## TL;DR (Īsumā)

**Dariet, ko gribat. Izmantojiet, kā vēlaties. Viss ir JŪSU atbildība.**

Man pretenziju nav un nebūs.

## The Full "License" (Pilns teksts)

You can:
- ✅ Use it (lietot)
- ✅ Modify it (mainīt)
- ✅ Share it (dalīties)
- ✅ Sell it (pārdot)
- ✅ Do literally anything (darīt JEBKO)

You should NOT:
- ❌ Blame me if something breaks (vainot mani, ja salūzt)
- ❌ Expect support (gaidīt atbalstu)
- ❌ Sue me (tiesāties ar mani)

**In other words:**
- I made this. I'm sharing it. Use it however you want.
- It works for me. Maybe it works for you. Maybe not.
- If it breaks your computer, loses your data, or causes world war 3 - NOT MY PROBLEM.
- No warranty. No guarantees. No liability. Zilch. Zero. Nada.

## Want to Say Thanks? (Хочешь сказать спасибо?) (Gribi pateikties?)

Not required, but appreciated! If this tool saved you time or helped you:

**Revolut:** @mrti4s1us
**PayPal:** @silegne

Like an old Latvian saying: "Aklai vistai arī kāds grauds trāpās" 😄

But seriously - no pressure. Sharing is caring. That's the whole point.

## Legal Mumbo-Jumbo (for those who care)

This is essentially "Public Domain" / "Do What The F*** You Want" / "Unlicense".

Formally based on WTFPL + MIT-0 spirit, but in plain language:
- No copyright claims
- No restrictions
- No conditions
- Complete freedom

Use at your own risk. Have fun!
